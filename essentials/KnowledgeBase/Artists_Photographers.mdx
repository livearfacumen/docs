# **Resource for Artists & Photographers**

## **Getting Started**

LIVEARf is your main tool for managing your products, setting prices, and letting customers see exactly how their artwork will look with different framing options. Setting up LIVEVUE involves three straightforward steps that will enhance how your customers view and interact with your products online.

### **Step 1: Configure Your Product Component**

1. **Launch the LIVEARf Application:** Begin by opening the LIVEARf app. Upon launching, you will see the guided three-step process for setting up LIVEVUE.

2. **Choose Your Component Type:** Click on the ‘Set Component’ option. This will present you with two foundational types of product components tailored to different business models:

- **Artwork Component:** This selection is specifically designed for artists and photographers who are selling their own completed work and wish to offer various framing and matting customizations alongside it.
- **Upload Component:** This option is intended for businesses that specialize in custom framing services where customers provide their own images to be printed and framed.

3. **Select the Artwork Component:** If your business focuses on displaying and selling your original or print artwork with framing choices, select the ‘Artwork Component’. This choice aligns the setup with presenting your art alongside customizable visual options like frames, mats, and more. 
4. **Explore Visualization Options:** After selecting the component type, click the ‘**Preview**’ button. This feature allows you to explore the range of visual customization options available to your customers. You will see interactive previews demonstrating different selections, such as varying **Artwork sizes**, different **Frame colors** and styles , adjustable **Mat sizes** (the border around the artwork) and a selection of **Mat colors**.

5. Once you have explored with the ‘Artwork Component’ choice, click ‘Use’ to establish this component type in the system in the app configuration page under “Art component”

6. A pop-up window will immediately appear, guiding you to connect this newly created component to a specific collection of your artwork products that you have already set up in your online store. Select the appropriate collection to establish the connection.

7. You can enter the desired option names to display in the front end and link them with the corresponding shopify collections. Below image shows the option for Frame, similarly you can add the collections for the remaining mat styles, mat size etc.
