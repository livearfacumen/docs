# **Resource For Custom Framers**

## **Getting Started**

**LIVEARf** is your essential tool for managing custom framing services, setting pricing, and allowing your customers to visualize their own photos framed and matted online. Setting up **LIVEVUE** involves a few easy steps that will significantly enhance how your customers interact with your offerings.\
\
Before you begin, ensure you've created an **"Upload product"** in your Shopify admin and added to a collection. This product should list all the print sizes you offer, along with their corresponding prices

### **Step 1: Configure Your Upload Component**

1. **Launch the LIVEARf Application:** Begin by opening the LIVEARf app. Upon launching, you will see the guided three-step process for setting up LIVEVUE.

2. **Choose Your Component Type:** Click on the ‘Set Component’ option. This will present you with two foundational types of product components tailored to different business models:

1. **Artwork Component:** This selection is specifically designed for artists and photographers who are selling their own completed work and wish to offer various framing and matting customizations alongside it.
2. **Upload Component:** This option is intended for businesses that specialize in custom framing services where customers provide their own images to be printed and framed.


3. **Select the Upload Component:** If your business focuses on custom framing services where customers upload their own photos, choose the **'Upload Component'**. This aligns your setup with allowing customers to visualize their personal images within your framing options.

4. **Explore Visualization Options:** After selecting the component type, click the **'Preview'** button. This feature lets you explore the various visual customization options available to your customers. You'll see interactive previews demonstrating different selections, such as:

- **Upload Button:** This allows you to upload a photo from your device to see a real-time visualization.
- **Crop Button:** This enables image editing functionality, where users can select the desired portion and also can adjust the orientation of their uploaded photo 
- **Frame Colors:** Displays the different frame colors you offer.
- **Mat Styles:** Shows the various matting styles available.
- **Mat Sizes:** Presents the different matting widths or options.

Experimenting with these combinations provides insight into how the frame and mat choices will visually complement and enhance your customers' uploaded photos on their screens.

5. Once you've explored the **'Upload Component'** choice, click **'Use'** to establish this component type in the system on the app configuration page under "Upload Component."

6. A pop-up window will immediately appear, guiding you to connect this newly created component to a specific **collection** in your online store. This collection should contain the **'upload product'** that defines the print sizes you offer for customer uploads. Select the appropriate collection to establish the connection.

7. You can enter the desired option names to display in the front end and link them with the corresponding shopify collections. Below image shows the option for Frame, similarly you can add the collections for the remaining mat styles, mat size etc.

Make sure the “Image Upload” toggle button is turned ON.

### **Step 2: Activating the LIVEVUE Template for Enhanced Display**

1. **Return to the LIVEVUE Settings:** Go back to the main **LIVEVUE** setup steps within the application and select step 2.

2. **Enable the New Template:** Click **'Save'** to enable the **LIVEVUE template**. This crucial step will integrate all the interactive visualization features seamlessly into your product page, replacing your standard layout with an optimized **LIVEVUE** template.

### **Step 3: Switching to the LIVEVUE Theme Template for Full Features**

1. **Find Your Product Listings:** Locate and open the Upload product that belongs to the collection you previously linked to the newly created LIVEVUE Upload component.
2. **Change to the ‘liveuue’ Template:**  Change the theme template from the ‘default’ option to the newly enabled ‘LiveVue’ template. This crucial step fully activates the interactive visualization features that are configured to appear and function on the buyer's page.

3. **Preview Your Configured Product Page: **With the ‘LIVEVUE’ theme template now active, click the ‘Preview’ button associated with the artwork product. This will open a view of your product page as your customers will see it, complete with all the selected and configured visualization options beautifully integrated.
4. **Test the Features as a Customer:** Try out the different choices on the page, by uploading a photo, using the crop tool, changing frames and mats, to make sure everything works correctly and provides a good experience for your buyers.
5. To enable all the products with the LIVEVUE template, you can bulk edit and change the template. You can refer to this[<u>video</u>](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KGVPzcHGt8gqbkZ93YzkFnBk0-SzIKhl/view?usp=sharing)  for additional guidance.

## **Setting Up Your Frame and Mat Choices**

For the initial setup, we've included basic frame color choices. To add your unique frame and mat options, navigate to 'Components' in the app's left sidebar. Click on 'Custom Component,' and you'll see the 'Upload Component.' Here, the sections for 'Mat Styles' and 'Frames' are configured to specific collections. Please add the collections containing your specific frames and mats to the corresponding 'Mat Styles' and 'Frames' sections.

## **Using our Frame Generator Tool: **

Our Frame Generator tool allows you to create your own unique frame designs. Follow the steps below to generate the frame.

- Find ‘Frame Generator’ in the left-hand menu of the app. 

- Click ‘Upload File’ to add an image of a long, straight piece of the frame you want to use. Make sure the image is a JPEG and long enough to work well. After uploading, crop the section you want and click ‘Click to Generate’.
- You’ll see a preview of the frame. If it looks right, select it and click ‘Update to Shopify’ to save it. 

- You can find these saved frame images in your Shopify account under ‘Content’ and then ‘Files’. 
- If you need to adjust a frame, just click ‘Regenerate’.
-  For each unique frame design you create, you’ll need to make a new product listing in your Shopify store. 
- When doing so, use the ‘Select Existing’ option to upload the saved frame image. Remember to add these frame products to the collection you linked to LIVEVUE.
